/**
 * The task `prs:` frontmatter read/write API.
 *
 * `prs:` is declared on exactly ONE entity schema — the task's
 * (`entities/task/schema.ts`) — so these helpers are task domain logic, not
 * generic frontmatter machinery, and they live here rather than in `lib/util`,
 * which carries only entity-agnostic pieces. Genuinely generic PR helpers
 * belong to the gh client (`@sksizer/easy-gh`).
 *
 * `prs:` is written ONCE, in the terminal close commit
 * ([[T-IVEJ-prs-once-at-close]]): `sdlc task close-commit` folds every PR URL
 * the task produced into the list through {@link computeAppendMany}. The
 * mid-flight per-PR append to `main` is retired — at PR-open the live binding
 * is the lease's `pr_number`, not this field.
 *
 * Exit-code contract, preserved deliberately: {@link PrsFieldError} encodes
 * `2` = task file not found and `1` = everything else. It is the read/write
 * failure taxonomy the close op surfaces; collapsing the two would flatten a
 * "task file missing" diagnostic into a generic parse failure.
