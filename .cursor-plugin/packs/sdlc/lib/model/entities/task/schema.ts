 * Task's only common-level required fields are `status` and `id` (the JSON

 *     packages/directories/modules this task expects to touch). A missing
 *     declared column on a present table trips `content/table/column-missing`
 *     as a fact, but this is advisory: `gap-report` deliberately does NOT fold
 *     an Areas-section content finding (nor a `structure/block-kind` on a
 *     prose/bulleted Areas) into a readiness gap — see
 *     `implementation-ready.md`'s `## Areas` entry.
 *   - `## Acceptance criteria` — a `- [ ] AC-N:` checklist: every item a checkbox
 *     (`content/list/item-kind` otherwise), ≥1 item (`content/list/min-items`).
 *   - `## Goal`, `## Acceptance criteria`, `## Out of scope` — required presence.

 * ([[D-VSLI-distributed-work-runner-architecture]]).
