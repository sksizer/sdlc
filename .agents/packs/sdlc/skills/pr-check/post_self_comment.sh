#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Post an orchestrator-authored comment to a PR and record the posted
# timestamp into the PR's pr-check cursor so the next /sdlc:pr-check
# tick can filter the orchestrator's own reply out of the
# new-entries set.
#
# Without this wrapper, every orchestrator-dispatched response posted
# via raw `gh pr comment` shows up to pr-check on the next tick as a
# net-new third-party comment (the orchestrator is authenticated as
# the user's GitHub identity, indistinguishable from real feedback)
# and the orchestrator wastes a dispatch on its own reply. The cursor
# field `self_posted_at: list[str]` is the precise filter — entries
# whose createdAt/submittedAt matches any timestamp in that list are
# dropped before the new-entries computation.
#
# Usage:
#   post_self_comment.sh <pr-number> <body>
#   post_self_comment.sh <pr-number> --body-file <path>
#
# Optional environment overrides (for tests):
#   PR_CHECK_CURSOR_DIR    Override the cursor directory.
#                          Default: <project-root>/.sdlc/pr-cursors/
#   PR_CHECK_PROJECT_ROOT  Override the project root.
#                          Default: $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
#                          or $PWD if not in a git repo.
#
# Exits 0 on success. Exits non-zero with an error on stderr if the
# `gh` post fails, the timestamp can't be captured, or the cursor file
# can't be written.
