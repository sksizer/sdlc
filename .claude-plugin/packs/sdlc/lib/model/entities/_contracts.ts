/**
 * The per-entity `markdown-contract` registry — `type → Contract`.
 *
 * Sibling to `_registry.ts` (which maps `type → Zod frontmatter schema`); this
 * one maps `type → Contract`, where each contract pairs that same Zod schema (its
 * frontmatter plane) with the entity's body grammar + content leaves. It is the
 * single lookup `entities validate` / `audit` / `authoring` route through,
 * replacing the retired presence-only `body-schema.yaml` body check.
 *
 * One contract per entity type, co-located at `<type>/schema.ts` (exported
 * alongside that type's Zod frontmatter schema).
