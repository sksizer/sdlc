/**
 * `sdlc task ensure-ready-mutate` — apply /sdlc:task-ensure-ready's pass/fail
 * verdict, by PLANE.
 *
 * Ported off `bun run ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/task-ensure-ready/ensure_ready_mutate.ts`
 * onto the op substrate ([[T-VAW3]] AC-2): that entry point's relative
 * `../../../../../lib/...` imports resolved only by accident of the in-repo
 * layout and broke once the plugin was copied outside this checkout.
 * `CliHints.rawArgv` (this op's own `main`/`defineCli` argv parsing, unchanged)
 * is the escape hatch — see its doc comment on `CliHints` in `lib/registry.ts`.
 *
 * The retired script also shelled a `bun run <path-to-cli/sdlc.ts>` SUBPROCESS
 * for `entities validate` and `lease release` — the exact `import.meta.url`-
 * relative path-guessing this whole migration exists to retire, and doubly
 * broken once bundled into the compiled binary (there is no `cli/sdlc.ts` on
 * disk to shell out to at all). Both now call the sibling op's `.handler`
 * directly, in-process — the established pattern for one op reusing another's
 * logic (see e.g. `lib/services/orchestrator/ticks/work.ts`).
 *
 * The readiness gate writes to whichever plane owns the fact
 * ([[D-S30G-task-state-plane-split]]). Four behaviors, keyed on
 * (active lease?) x (pass/fail):
 *
 * | Case | Behavior |
 * |---|---|
 * | Pass, unleased, `planning/*` | ONE promotion commit: `status: open/ready` + `readiness_verified_at` (+ drop `definition_gap`). Promotion IS the readiness claim. |
 * | Pass, unleased, already `open/ready` | No-op — the file stays byte-identical. Unless a `definition_gap` is present: clearing it is a semantic edit and keeps its commit. The stamp is never refreshed. |
 * | Pass, active lease | CAS-write the lease `gates` only. Zero commits on main, no frontmatter write. |
 * | Fail | Downshift to `planning/needs-definition` + `definition_gap` — except the carve-out, which preserves status when the input is `in-progress*` OR an active lease exists (post-split a leased task reads `open/ready`, and downshifting it would corrupt live work). |
 *
 * Terminal markers (slug-namespaced per skills/CLAUDE.md):
 *
 *     ENSURE-READY-OK: <basename>
 *     readiness_verified_at: <iso|->
 *     plane: frontmatter-promotion | lease-gates | none
 *
 *     ENSURE-READY-NEEDS-DEFINITION: <basename>
 *     definition_gap: <first line of gap>
 *
 *     ENSURE-READY-LEASED: <basename>
 *
 * Exit codes ([[S-0015-standalone-cli-shape]] rule 4): 0 ok / 1 the command
 * failed against the state it found / 2 the command was typed wrong / 12
 * (`LEASE_CONFLICT`) `--commit` refused because an active lease exists / 19
 * the commit or the lease write was refused-or-failed / 20 the input status is
 * not one this gate accepts.
 *
 * Frontmatter edits are span-preserving (`lib/util/frontmatter.ts`): the block
 * is never re-emitted whole.
